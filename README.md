# NMake

NMake is an asynchronous, event-drive build tools.

## Goals

NMake's primary goal is to make an excellent tool for small jobs,
like building npm modules in a particular order.
Only after creating a successful tool for small jobs will NMake
attempt to tackle large scale jobs.

Secondly, each NMake file should be a Node.js module.
